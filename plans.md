Fonts 

Use simple, sans serif fonts with adequate spacing between letters. Use at least at 18px font size 

Good sans serif font examples include: 

Calibri 

Franklin Gothic Book 

Lucida Sans 

Segoe UI 

Avoid compressed, fancy, italic or underlined fonts or fonts with uneven line weights 

Text 

Ideally, limit the number of limes each slide to 7 

Ideally limit the number of works on each line to 6 

Leave plenty of space above and below each line 

Speaker Notes 

Instead of adding all the content on a slide, use speaker notes to provide more in-depth information. By default, speaker notes are formatted in a readable, sans serif font 

Distribute your slide after your presentation, so audience can refer to the slides and notes to recall the verbal presentation delivery 

 

Layout and Design 

Background 

Pure white background can make text harder to read. Choose an off-white or cream background 

Images 

A great way to break up blocks of text and make your slide easier to scan. 

Add alternative text to every image 

Layout 

A colourful, high-contrast graphic layout, combined with pictures and text, creates a structured design
